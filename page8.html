        <h1>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h1><p>



        </p>

        The demanding nature of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has forced businesses to re-think the way they conduct their activities when using personal data. Marketing is certainly not an exception, especially in the digital environment.
        <div>

        </div>Whether your organisation conducts data analysis concerning its customers’ online activity or whether it simply uses a mailing list to send electronic marketing, such activities need to be framed within the context of the stricter obligations imposed under the GDPR.<p>


        </p>
In addition, as if the GDPR was not enough, the processing of personal data involving electronic communications, should also consider specific rules contained under the e-Privacy regime. This is currently being remodelled in a stricter regulation which will bring the existing framework into balance with the rules applied under the GDPR.<p>


</p>

We should lawfully make a declaration that we license our work for free use and that it is their own work and any sources of information are referenced to their owner. They should not use copyright tools or information without first gaining permission (or have it provided directly in the license).<p>
