                <h1>Review</h1><div>


                </div>

                This Page is to review my ongoing use of IT tools that I used to create this website, Tools I used include the programmes called Visual Studio Code (VS) and Trello.<p>



                </p>
                1.2.1<p></p>
Both of these were completely new to me, never even heard of them before.
Instructions on how to use them both were pretty straight forward and easy to take a grasp of after several times of reading over and over, as it was a complete different language.<div>

</div>
Trello too was a complete new experience as it is an app that needs paying for, I would never use it again in day to day life. Although it offers a free trial of 12 boards, it seems to do the trick into getting the coursework started.<div>


</div>

To be able to get this far into my Project in the short space of time we had is a life Achievement for me as previously stated on the 'ABOUT ME' page, my skills very very limited to what i could actually do.<div></div> I still personally think this is the case as we only had a short space of time to learn and actually understand the task we were supposed to carry out.
Although this site i have made is not complete it will require alot of ongoing support and maintenance.
<div>


</div>
1.2.2<p></p>
The IT tools that were selected were appropriate, i have reviewed the outcomes and they seem fit for purpose.

<div>


</div>
1.2.3 / 1.2.4<p></p>
As it stands i am Happy with my website giving the time we had to complete it and have it published,
Using the suggested tools made it a little easy as the Trello board had a spell checker, im not a touch typist so i dont look  at the screen as im typing and usually make lots of spelling mistakes. If we had more time to plan and edit our sites i think i would have done a few things diffently,maybe a change of theme however i am satisfied with my Family Guy theme, but i would like to find some better quality images and gif's that i could play around with, make them more presentable and id like to have the font to catch the audiences attention for  longer than it does.  <div>

    1.2.5<p></p>
I have reviewed all possible outcomes and they are fit for purpose.
<div>

    1.3.1<p></p>
    I can evaluate the productivity and efficiency of IT systems and procedures<div>

    </div>
<img src=table.jpg><p>

</p><div>
    1.3.2<p></p>
    I can research and advise ways to improve productivity and efficiency<div></div>

    we can Start by writing a list of things that cam help to improve productivity and efficiency,
.<div></div> 1, Stop Multitasking
<div></div>  2, Take Breaks
<div></div> 3, set small goals
<div></div> 4, take care of the bigger tasks when were most alert.
<div></div> 5, Impplement the 'Two - Minute Rule'


</div>
1.3.3 / 4<p>
</p>I can test solutions to make sure that they work as intended<div></div>
I had a few instances of bad formatting, spelling errors, or other obvious errors that could be eliminated by simple checks. We could possibly check and assess each others' work and to receive feedback graciously when others find errors.  Then Fix errors directly or find out how to.<p>


</p><div>
    1.3.5<div>
            I can recommend improvements to IT systems and procedures that increase productivity .<div>
                    At this level we are reasonably well experienced users of IT and will have worked on complex projects and applications.  All of this skill and experience, as well as their confidence, should allow them to see weaknesses in systems, including theirs and others, and recommend ways to improve them.  They should see where procedures are creating issues and slowing down projects and be able to see all areas of a project from the perspective of an IT manager to see how to improve things.
