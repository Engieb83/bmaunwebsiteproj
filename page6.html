        <h1>Describe how you would go about selecting  and using IT systems and software â€“  how do you  select the right kind of technology for the job?</h1><p>



        </p> 
        I would use any previous experience I have with laptops / desktops to decide which technology I believe would perform the best to what Is required,<p>


        </p>

For example in using a Lenovo Thinkpad to type this and the battery life on this machine is very poor, it has fails to hold a HDMI slot too, is not ideal to show Videos, slides or any work on an external screen to a greater audience if I had 1,<p>

</p>

However laptops are mobile unlike desktops which we would struggle to carry around as they are heavy, bulky and usually come in several pieces.<div></div>
With laptops we can carry them around, open them up and log on at our convenience. <p>

</p>

Tables to illustrate the differences between a choice or multiple, and similar comparisons would be very useful in this situation so others can see and judge for themselves which kind of technology is the right kind for the job.
