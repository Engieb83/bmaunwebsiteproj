    <h1>Describing methods, skills and resources  needed to complete digital projects successfully â€“  what do you need to make projects successful?  What tools? What skills?</h1>  


        To make projects successful, we as candidates or employee's should be able to systematically analyse a task and match needs to resources. we should be able to describe the methods, skills and resources we need in some detail.

For example, as a method of presenting information to a general audience, using web pages is often a better choice than desktop presentation software. In a web page, the information is permanently and immediately available to the intended wide audience and this information can be linked to related information in other pages.<div>

</div> These web pages can also be web page resources such as cloud based office files. They might need skills related to e.g. preparing images for use on-line so they are suitable sizes and load quickly on low bandwidth connections. They can describe issues related to copyright which are Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) and accessibility if they intend others to use the information they prepare. The resources needed could include time, software, hardware or new learning and expertise.
