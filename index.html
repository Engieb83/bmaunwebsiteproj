<h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
    <p>
        Hello my name is Ben, You may call me a Family Guy, I have 7 kids, 5 of my own and I have taken 2 as my own. I enjoy chocolate and my favourite food is Pizza,<div>
        I broke my back in 2015, I am currently unemployed due to my physical condition, so I thought about a future in IT,
        My eldest 2 are teenagers and when it comes to technology I haven't got a clue, I rely on my son and daughters to help with today's current technology.
        so I thought 'what about a career in IT?' Something I can do from the comfort of my own home, without leaving the house..
        nothing is that easy, there's a lot that i need to learn, as I feel I don't have a clue. Nobody's ever too old and we all have to start somewhere,
